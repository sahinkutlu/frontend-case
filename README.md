<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Rick and Morty Multiselect][product-screenshot]](https://rick-and-morty-multi-select-nine.vercel.app/)

**Application Overview:** I developed an application using Adobe’s React Aria components. The primary reasons for this choice were their asynchronous list structure and customizable components.

**Component Development:** Initially, I started with the combobox, but I realized that it does not support multiple selections beyond general usage. As a result, I created my own input component.

**Multiselect Component:** This led to the creation of a multiselect component that allows searching and multiple selections.

**Navigation:** You can navigate between selected items and input with the tab key. When you are in the input field and press the down arrow, the list opens.

**Selection:** After the list opens, you can navigate up and down between the list items and make a selection with the enter key.

**Detail Modal:** Similarly, when you click on a selected item in the input or press the space or enter key while it is selected, the detail modal opens.
